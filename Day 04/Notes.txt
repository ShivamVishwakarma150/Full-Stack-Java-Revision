Thread priorities
=================

For every Thread in java has some priority.
valid range of priority is 1 to 10,it is not 0 to 10.
if we try to give a differnt value the it would result in "IllegalArgumentException".
Thread.MIN_PRIORITY = 1
Thread.MAX_PRIORITY = 10
Thread.NORM_PRIORITY = 5
Thread class does not have priorities is Thread.LOW_PRIORITY,Thread.HIGH_PRIORITY.
Thread scheduler allocates cpu time based on "Priority".
If both the threads have the same priority then which thread will get a chance as a pgm we can't
predict becoz it is vendor dependent.
We can set and get priority values of the thread using the following methods
    a. public final void setPriority(int priorityNumber)
    b. public final int getPriority()
The allowed priorityNumber is from 1 to 10,if we try to give other values it would result in
"IllegalArgumentException".
    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().setPriority(100);//IllegalArgumentException.

DefaultPriority
=================

The default priority for only main thread is "5",where as for other threads priority will be inherited from parent to child.
Parent Thread priority will be given as Child Thread Priority.

eg#1.
class MyThread extends Thread{}
public class TestApp{
    public static void main(String ... args){
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getPriority());//5
        Thread.currentThread().setPriority(7);
        MyThread t= new MyThread();
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getPriority());//7
    }
}

MyThread

MyThread is creating by "mainThread", so priority of "mainThread" will be shared as a priority for "MyThread".

eg#2.
class MyThread extends Thread{
    @Override
    public void run(){
        for (int i=1;i <= 5 ;i++ ){
        System.out.printIn("child thread");
        }
    }
}

Since priority of child thread is more than main thread, jvm will execute child thread first
whereas for the parent thread priority is 5 so it will get last chance.
if we comment line-1, then we can't predict the order of execution becoz both the threads have
same priority.
    Some platform won't provide proper support for Thread priorities.
    eg :: windows7,windows10, ...


yield() => It causes to pause current executing Thread for giving chance for waiting Threads of
same priority.
    If there is no waiting Threads or all waiting Threads have low priority then same Thread can continue its execution.
    If all the threads have same priority and if they are waiting then which thread will get chance we can't expect, it depends on ThreadScheduler.
    The Thread which is yielded, when it will get the chance once again depends on the mercy on "ThreadScheduler" and we can't expect exactly.
    public static native void yield()

MyThread t= new MyThread() //new state or born state
    t.start() // enter into ready state/runnable state
if ThreadScheduler allocates processor then enters into running state.
    a. if running Thread calls yield() then it enters into runnable state.
if run() is finished with execution then it enters into dead state.

eg#1.
class MyThread extends Thread{

    @Override
    public void run(){
        for (int i=1;i <= 5 ;i++ ){
        System.out.println("child thread");
        Thread.yield();//line-1
        }

    }
}

public class TestApp{
    public static void main(String ... args){
        MyThread t= new MyThread();
        t.start();
        for (int i=1;i <= 5 ;i++ ){
            System.out.println("Parent Thread");
        }

    }
}

Note ::
If we comment line-1, then we can't expect the output becoz both the threads have same priority then which thread the ThreadScheduler will schedule is not in the hands of programmer

but if we don't comment line-1, then there is a possibility of main thread getting more no of times, so main thread execution is faster then child thread will get chance.

Note: Some platforms wont provide proper support for yield(),becuase it is getting the execution
code from other language prefereably from 'C'.



b. join()
    If the thread has to wait untill the other thread finishes its execution then we need to go for join().
    if t1 executes t2.join() then t1 should should wait till t2 finishes its execution.
    t1 will be entered into waiting state untill t2 completes, once t2 completes then t1 can continue with its execution.

eg#1.
venue fixing ========> t1.start()
wedding card printing =======> t2.start()====> t1.join()
wedding card distrubution ====> t3.start() ====> t2.join()


Note: While one thread is in waiting state and if one more thread interupts then it would result
in "InteruptedException".InteruptedException is checkedException which should always be
handled.

Thread t =new Thread();//new/born state
t.start();//ready/runnable state
-> If T.S allocates cpu time then Thread enters into running state
-> If currently executing Thread invokes t.join(),t.join(1000),t.join(1000,100), then it
would enter into waiting state.
-> If the thread finishes the execution/time expires/interupted then it would come back to
ready state/runnable state.
-> If run() is completed then it would enter into dead state.


class MyThread extends Thread{
    @Override
    public void run(){
        for (int i=1;i <= 10 ;i++.){
            System.out.printin("Sita Thread");
            try{

            Thread.sleep(2000);

            catch (InterruptedException e){
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Test3 {
    public static void main(String ... args)throws InterruptedException{
        MyThread t=new MyThread();
        t.start();
        t.join(10000);//line-n1
        
        for (int i=1;i <= 10;i++){
        System.out.printIn("rama thread");
        }

    }

}


sleep()
===========
If a thread dont' want to perform any operation for a particular amount of time then we
should go for sleep().

Signature
    public static native void sleep(long ms) throws InterruptedException
    public static void sleep(long ms,int ns) throws InterruptedException

every sleep method throws InterruptedException, which is a checkedexception so we should compulsorily handle the exception using
try catch or by throws keyword otherwise it would result in compile time error.

Thread t=new Thread(); //new or born state
t.start() // ready/runnable state

=> If T.S allocates cpu time then it would enter into running state.
=> If run() completes then it would enter into dead state.


=> If running thread invokes sleep(1000)/sleep(1000,100) then it would enter into Sleeping state
=> If time expires/'if steeping thread got interrupted then thread would come back to "ready/runnable state".



eg#1.
public class SlideRotator {
    public static void main(String ... args)throws InterruptedException{

        for (int i=1;i <= 10 ;i++){
        System.out.printin("Slide: "+i);
        Thread.sleep(5000);
        }

    }
}

Output ::
Slide :: 1
Slide :: 2
Slide :: 3
Slide :: 4
Slide :: 5
Slide :: 6
Slide :: 7
Slide :: 8
Slide :: 9
Slide :: 10
